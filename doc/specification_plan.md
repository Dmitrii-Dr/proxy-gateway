1. Introduction
Purpose: Clearly state the purpose of the service registry. Why is it needed? What problem does it solve? (e.g., dynamic service discovery, load balancing, etc.)
Scope: Define the scope of the document. What aspects of the service registry are covered? What is explicitly not covered?
Target Audience: Who is this document for? (Developers, operations, testers, etc.) This will influence the level of detail.
Document Conventions: Explain any specific formatting, terminology, or style conventions used in the document.

2. Goals and Non-Goals
Goals: List the primary objectives of the service registry. What should it achieve? Be specific and measurable where possible.
Non-Goals: Clearly state what the service registry is not intended to do. This helps manage expectations and avoid scope creep.

3. Technology Stack
Programming Language: (e.g., Java)
Framework: (e.g., Quarkus)
Database: (e.g., PostgreSQL)
Build Tool: (e.g., Maven)
Other Dependencies: List any other significant libraries or components.

4. Data Model
Entities: Define the core entities managed by the service registry (e.g., Service, Instance, HealthCheck). For each entity:
Attributes: Specify each attribute, its data type, constraints (e.g., required, unique), and a clear description.
Relationships: Describe how the entities relate to each other (e.g., a Service has multiple Instances).
Database Schema: Provide the detailed database schema, including table names, column names, data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes. A diagram can be helpful.

5. Functional Requirements
Service Registration:
Describe the process of registering a service.
Specify the required information (e.g., service name, URL, metadata).
Define how updates to existing registrations are handled (idempotency).
Outline any validation rules for registration data.
Service Discovery:
Describe how clients discover services.
Specify the search criteria (e.g., service name, tags, version).
Define the format of the discovery results.
Health Checks:
Describe the health check mechanism.
Specify the types of health checks supported (e.g., HTTP, TCP).
Define the criteria for determining service health.
Explain how unhealthy services are handled (e.g., removed from discovery).
Metadata Management:
Describe how services can add and manage metadata (e.g., version, environment, custom properties).
Specify the format and storage of metadata.
Security:
Describe the security measures in place to protect the service registry (e.g., authentication, authorization).
Specify how services authenticate themselves during registration.
Define access control policies for service discovery.
